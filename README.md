# Retroactive Advantage

This module allows a user to re-roll a d20 roll from the output chat card to change its advantage status. It does not affect any other module's logic based on the original roll.

## Features

Provides buttons for any d20 roll chat card to change the roll's advantage status and resulting display. As much as possible, all existing dice rolls which are still relevant to the new mode will be used.

For example: If a d20 roll was rolled with advantage, the user will be able to set that to not have advantage or to instead be at disadvantage.
